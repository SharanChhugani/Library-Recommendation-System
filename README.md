# Library-Recommendation-System
The Book Recommendation system as the name suggests is an application where
we perform classification,segregation,etc and suggest books to users from their
past and other books that are relevant. This report touches the basic introduction
to an Recommendation system and later goes into explaining various methods
etc and then explaining K-means algorithm and other working of the project.


Technology to be used
-Jupyter Notebook
-Python (pandas,numpy,sklearn,matplotlib, etc)
-HTML,CSS,JS,Php,SQL

K Means
This is an iterative algorithm that does partition in the dataset into K already
defined unique non-overlapping clusters where every point belongs to a single
group. It will try to make the inter-cluster points as similar to other
inter-clusters as possible while keeping them as far as possible. Then it will
assign data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance
between all points and the clusterâ€™s centroid is at the least. The lesser the
variation within clusters, the more similar the data points are inside the same
cluster.
